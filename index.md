Maybe this not working because of a missing layout header
[Linky linky](linky linky)

```lua
local function test()
 for v,i in ipairs({1,2,3}) do print(v, i); end
end
```

## Heading

and here we have texty text, what can we do? _this_ should be something, alas
*this* should be something else.

1. one two three
2. testing testing testing
3. last numbered point

then we use some dotydots:
. hi
. there
. I am godzilla

there see to be some problem with the theme applying or not

# Some other heading

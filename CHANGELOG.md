# 0.6.0 - 0.6.1
* universal open/save:
Clients that announce support for global open/save via bchunk-hints

* display/share and target/share reworked:
Display/region/ based sharing removed (except for snapshot/monitor)
in favoring of a /target/share menu that consolidate all such options.

* uiprim/sbar:
statusbar custom button controls added, it is now possible to define
alt-action (such as custom popup spawn) as well as drag-action.

* workspace buttons now popup layout mode selector on altclick, and

titlebar rclick now mappable (default, popup /target)

* uiprim/popup:
added basic popup component

* target-launch:

This tool implements basic gestures, commands and mapping for rotary devices
like the 'Surface Dial' and 'Griffin PowerMate'.

(/menus) and are intended for shortcut button grids, popup menus, radial menus
and so on.

* workspaces assignment:
It is now possible to control which workspace new windows currently spawn at,
see the /global/settings/workspaces/spawn path.

New gestures, 'tap', 'doubletap', 'idle\_return', 'idle\_enter'. improved
relative mouse emulation to better handle click-select refactored some of the
code to more easilly accomodate custom classifiers. Some device profile based
values can now be changed through the path /global/input/touch. A classifier
that forwards as basic touch events has been added.

* first round of (non-text) icon management (caching, shared sets etc.) added

* displays/current/zoom added:
Bind to keyboard for zooming in/out around the mouse cursor position

* new tool: streamdeck
This allows external mini displays (touchbars etc.) to be hooked up and
act as restricted input devices as well as custom widget mappings

* new tool: todo
This tool allows for simple tracking of todo tasks that integrate with
the notification system, status bars and so on.

* new tool: tracing
This tool mixes the monitoring wm inspection parts of durden with the

  text on for all new terminal windows (feature still experimental)

rate when there are multiple to chose from at the desired resolution

* added controls to insert subwindows as new windows or relative to their
parents, (global/settings/workspaces/tiled/subwindow=normal,child)

icon rather than a longer text representation

* added 'invert light' shader that retains most of hue while inverting
  dark/light colors

* handover subsegment allocation now routes correctly

  recover properly when started back up.

* /windows/name added for individual explicit window addressing

* started refactoring and splitting uiprim.lua

* started refactoring and splitting tiler.lua

* allow disabling meta-guard (rebinding) via /input/keyboard/meta\_guard

* gconf.lua split up into config.lua (keys) and gconf.lua (mgmt code)

* /bindtarget=/some/path sets a 'consume on use' path that allows interactive
  menu paths like key and button bindings to be automated

* target/window/move\_fx/fy added for display- size relative move

* firstrun.lua added to setup custom defaults on first run/config reset

* added color picker widget

at minimal cost.

    options have been merged into the YES/NO paths that have been
    extended with YES/NO/FLIP

  * reworked multi-display state management / restoration / discovery

  * mouse should now work better with the HUD menu, particularly
	  mouse-wheel, navigation button clicks and right-click to exit.

    group share the same logical window tree slot.

  * Tui/terminal clients are now allowed to spawn additional tui
    subsegments. This match the new support in afsrv_terminal that
